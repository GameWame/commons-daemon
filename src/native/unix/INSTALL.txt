To build the service libraries and binary under an UNIX operating
system you will need:

  An ANSI-C compliant compiler (GCC is good)
  GNU AutoConf
  A Java Platform 2 compliant SDK

First of all you need to build the "configure" program with:

   sh support/buildconf.sh
(Note it is possible to replace sh by any compatible shell like bash, ksh).

Once the configure script is generated, run it (remember to specify
either the --with-java=<dir> parameter or set the JAVA_HOME environment
to point to your JDK installation. For example:

  ./configure --with-java=/usr/java

or

  JAVA_HOME=/usr/java
  export JAVA_HOME
  ./configure

If your operating system is supported, configure will go thru cleanly,
otherwise it will report an error (please send us the details of your
OS/JDK, or a patch against the sources). To build the binaries and
libraries simply do:

  make

This will generate the file:  ./jsvc.
It should be straightforward from here on. To check the allowed parameters
for the jsvc binary simply do

  ./native/jsvc -help
