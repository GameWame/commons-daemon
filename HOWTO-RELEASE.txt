How to do a Apache Commons Daemon release
=========================================

Use Java 7.

Check out a clean copy of commons daemon from subversion to
make sure you don't have any lingering configure or build files.
This will make sure that the source distribution created is clean.

We assume, that you checked out
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/daemon/trunk
to a directory named daemon. All further path names will be relative to this
directory.

If you haven't already, add your public PGP key to KEYS.

Update version numbers as needed
--------------------------------

Do a find for all the docs which include the previous version string
and replace it with the new version.

These include:
Before tagging:
 - /src/changes/changes.xml             (Set date)
 - /src/native/unix/man/jsvc1.xml       (Set date & version)
 - TODO list other files
Only in tag:
 - /pom.xml                             (remove -SNAPSHOT)
 - /src/native/unix/native/version.h    (JSVC_IS_DEV_VERION 0)


Create native build scripts
---------------------------

cd /src/native/unix
sh support/buildconf.sh
rm -rf automate.cache


Native build
------------

Build and sign the Windows binaries.
Place the signed Windows binaries in:
target/prunsrv.exe
target/prunmgr.exe
target/amd64/prunsrv.exe


Maven tasks
-----------

To deploy the Java jars to the Nexus staging repo:

mvn clean
mvn deploy -Prelease [-Ptest-deploy]

The test-deploy profile will deploy to target/deploy; omit for the live deploy

Note: do not use clean in the same invocation.
Remove the following artifacts and associated hashes/sigs before closing the
repo:
- tests.jar         (there are no tests, just a simple sample)
- test-sources.jar  (there are no tests, just a simple sample)
Do not remove the binary distributions since some users depend on Maven Central
to obtain these.
